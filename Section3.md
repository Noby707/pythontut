# Section 3: Understanding Variables
----------------------------------------

Variables are just boxes that hold things.
They're super simple and in previous sections you've
used them already. I bring them up because it's
important to understand variables completely before
we go to the next section.

```python
def add2Numbers(a, b):
    sumOfNums = a + b # sumOfNums is a variable
    print(sumOfNums)
```

The next example doesn't really do much
but it demonstrates what a variable is.

```python
def aBunchOfVariables():
    x = 4 # a Variable
    y = 10 # another variable
    z = 99 # also a variable
    aWord = 'Fuck the Police' # a variable holding a bunch of letters
    product = x * y * z # more variables
    print(aWord)
    print(product)
```

Variables help things look nicer and make things easier to understand
Instead of your program being full of numbers, your program
becomes full of easy to understand words. It's the same reason
we name functions nice things.

```python
def aFunction(inputVar):
    limit = 10

    if inputVar < limit:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')
```

# END of Section 3: Understanding Variables

If you're not sure why variables are useful
then it will make more sense when you write larger programs.
By assigning values to variables programs become easier to understand
