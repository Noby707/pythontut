# Section 7: Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
----------------------------------------------------

Most new programming languages (including python)
are what are called 'object oriented' languages.
This means they have something called 'classes' and 'objects'.
For people learning how to program, classes and objects are
one of the hardest things to understand. They are very simple
and useful once you master them but it's super hard to get
your head around what they are if you've never used them.
